Introduction to GD&T
Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) is a symbolic language used on engineering drawings to communicate design intent, manufacturing requirements, and inspection criteria. It provides a precise method for describing the geometry of parts and assemblies, going beyond traditional plus/minus tolerancing to control form, orientation, location, and runout of features.

GD&T is standardized internationally through ASME Y14.5 (American) and ISO 1101 (International) standards, ensuring consistent interpretation across different organizations and countries.

Why Use GD&T?
Traditional coordinate tolerancing has limitations that GD&T addresses:

Limitations of Traditional Tolerancing:

Assumes perfect form at maximum material condition
Can be overly restrictive or inadequately controlled
Difficulty communicating functional requirements
Potential for misinterpretation
Benefits of GD&T:

Functional Design: Controls relate directly to how parts function in assemblies
Manufacturing Efficiency: Allows for optimized manufacturing processes
Quality Control: Provides clear inspection criteria
Cost Reduction: Eliminates unnecessary precision while maintaining function
International Communication: Standardized symbols reduce language barriers
Design Intent: Clearly communicates what is critical vs. what is not
Basic Concepts and Terminology
Key Terms
Feature: Any physical portion of a part (surfaces, holes, slots, etc.)

Feature of Size: A cylindrical or spherical surface, or a set of two opposed parallel surfaces, each of which is associated with a size dimension

Datum: A theoretically exact point, line, or plane derived from the datum feature

Datum Feature: An actual feature of the part used to establish a datum

Tolerance Zone: The zone within which a feature must lie

Virtual Condition: The boundary generated by the collective effects of size and geometric tolerances

The 14 GD&T Symbols
GD&T uses 14 primary geometric characteristic symbols, organized into five categories:

Form Controls (Shape of Individual Features):

⏤ Straightness
○ Flatness
○ Circularity (Roundness)
⌭ Cylindricity
Orientation Controls (Relative to Datums):

⟂ Perpendicularity
∠ Angularity
∥ Parallelism
Location Controls (Position Relative to Datums):

⊕ Position
⌖ Concentricity
≡ Symmetry
Runout Controls (Composite of Form, Orientation, and Location):

↗ Circular Runout
↗↗ Total Runout
Profile Controls (Complex Surfaces and Boundaries):

⌒ Profile of a Line
⌓ Profile of a Surface
Datum Reference Framework
The datum reference framework establishes the coordinate system for geometric controls. It consists of three mutually perpendicular planes that simulate the part's functional relationship in its assembly.

Datum Precedence
Primary Datum (First): Contacts at least 3 points, constrains 3 degrees of freedom
Secondary Datum (Second): Contacts at least 2 points, constrains 2 additional degrees of freedom
Tertiary Datum (Third): Contacts at least 1 point, constrains the final degree of freedom
Datum Selection Guidelines
Choose datums that represent functional surfaces
Primary datum should be the most important functional surface
Datums should be easily accessible for manufacturing and inspection
Consider stability (larger, more stable surfaces preferred)
Maintain consistency throughout the drawing
Form Controls
Form controls specify the shape characteristics of individual features without reference to other features or datums.

Straightness (⏤)
Controls how much a line element or axis can deviate from a perfect straight line.

Surface Straightness: Applied to line elements on a surface
Axis Straightness: Applied to the axis of cylindrical features
Flatness (○)
Controls how much a surface can deviate from a perfect plane. All points on the surface must lie between two parallel planes separated by the tolerance value.

Circularity/Roundness (○)
Controls the roundness of circular features in cross-section. Each circular element must lie between two concentric circles separated by the tolerance value.

Cylindricity (⌭)
Controls the form of an entire cylindrical surface. The entire surface must lie between two concentric cylinders separated by the tolerance value.

Orientation Controls
Orientation controls specify the orientation of features relative to datums but do not control location.

Perpendicularity (⟂)
Controls how perpendicular a feature is to a datum. The tolerance zone is the area between two parallel planes, lines, or surfaces perpendicular to the datum.

Parallelism (∥)
Controls how parallel a feature is to a datum. The tolerance zone is the area between two parallel planes, lines, or surfaces parallel to the datum.

Angularity (∠)
Controls the angle of a feature relative to a datum at any specified angle other than 90° or 0°.

Location Controls
Location controls specify the location of features relative to datums and may also control orientation and form.

Position (⊕)
The most commonly used GD&T control. Defines a tolerance zone within which the center, axis, or center plane of a feature must lie. Position tolerance creates a cylindrical tolerance zone for round features and a parallel-sided zone for other features.

Key Benefits:

Functional relationship to mating parts
Bonus tolerance available with material condition modifiers
Clear inspection methods
Concentricity (⌖)
Controls the coaxial relationship of two or more cylindrical features. The axis of the toleranced feature must lie within a cylindrical tolerance zone whose axis coincides with the datum axis.

Symmetry (≡)
Controls the symmetrical relationship of features across a center plane. The center plane of the toleranced feature must lie between two parallel planes separated by the tolerance value and symmetrically disposed about the datum center plane.

Runout Controls
Runout controls are composite controls that simultaneously control form, orientation, and location relative to a datum axis.

Circular Runout (↗)
Controls circular elements of a surface independently. Each circular element is measured separately as the part is rotated about the datum axis.

Total Runout (↗↗)
Controls the entire surface simultaneously. The entire surface is evaluated as the part is rotated about the datum axis, providing control over form, orientation, and location.

Profile Controls
Profile controls specify the tolerance zone for complex surfaces and can control form, orientation, location, and size.

Profile of a Line (⌒)
Controls the form of individual line elements across a surface. Each line element must lie between two parallel boundaries separated by the tolerance value.

Profile of a Surface (⌓)
Controls the form of an entire surface. The entire surface must lie between two parallel boundaries separated by the tolerance value.

Material Condition Modifiers
Material condition modifiers specify the condition of a feature when a geometric tolerance applies.

Maximum Material Condition (MMC) Ⓜ
The condition where a feature contains the maximum amount of material:

External features: Maximum size
Internal features: Minimum size
Benefits:

Bonus tolerance available
Allows for functional gaging
Optimizes manufacturing efficiency
Least Material Condition (LMC) Ⓛ
The condition where a feature contains the least amount of material:

External features: Minimum size
Internal features: Maximum size
Regardless of Feature Size (RFS)
The default condition where geometric tolerance applies regardless of the feature's actual size. No additional tolerance is gained or lost based on size.

Feature Control Frames
Feature control frames contain all the information needed to specify a geometric tolerance:

Structure (left to right):

Geometric characteristic symbol
Tolerance value and modifier (if applicable)
Primary datum reference and modifier (if applicable)
Secondary datum reference and modifier (if applicable)
Tertiary datum reference and modifier (if applicable)
Example Frame Components:

|⊕|Ø0.5|Ⓜ|A|Ⓜ|B|Ⓜ|C|
Position tolerance
Ø0.5 tolerance at MMC
Referenced to datums A, B, C at MMC
Common Applications
Hole Patterns
Position tolerance is ideal for controlling bolt hole patterns, ensuring proper assembly with mating parts while allowing manufacturing flexibility.

Shaft and Bore Assemblies
Runout controls ensure smooth rotation and proper fit between rotating components.

Machined Surfaces
Flatness and straightness controls ensure proper seating and contact between mating surfaces.

Complex Contours
Profile controls accommodate complex curved surfaces found in aerospace, automotive, and consumer products.

Best Practices
Drawing Practices
Minimize the number of datums - Use only what's necessary for function
Be consistent - Use the same datum references for related features
Consider inspection - Ensure tolerances can be reasonably measured
Start with function - Base tolerances on how the part will be used
Use appropriate controls - Don't over-constrain non-critical features
Tolerance Selection
Consider manufacturing processes - Match tolerances to process capabilities
Account for assembly requirements - Ensure proper fit and function
Balance cost and function - Tighter tolerances increase cost
Use material condition modifiers - Take advantage of bonus tolerance when appropriate
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Over-tolerancing non-functional features
Mixing coordinate and geometric tolerancing inappropriately
Not considering inspection methods during design
Ignoring material condition effects
Poor datum selection and hierarchy
Practical Examples

Critical sealing surfaces
Bolt hole patterns at different elevations
Internal passages with position requirements
Application:

Profile tolerance for sealing surfaces
Position tolerance for bolt patterns
Composite position tolerance for passage alignment
Multiple datum reference frames as needed
Summary
GD&T provides a powerful and precise method for communicating design intent on engineering drawings. By understanding and properly applying these fundamentals, engineers can create designs that are functional, manufacturable, and inspectable while optimizing cost and quality.

The key to successful GD&T implementation is understanding that geometric tolerances should reflect the functional requirements of the design. Start with how the part will be used, consider manufacturing and inspection capabilities, and apply the appropriate controls to ensure the part will perform its intended function.

Remember that GD&T is a language - like any language, proficiency comes with study, practice, and experience. Continue to reference current standards (ASME Y14.5 or ISO 1101) for detailed requirements and stay current with evolving practices in the field.

This document provides fundamental training in GD&T concepts. For detailed implementation and advanced applications, consult current ASME Y14.5 or ISO 1101 standards and consider additional specialized training.
