**Git for Managers Who Don’t Know What Git Is**

*Version 1.0 | Written for engineering, IT, and operations leads who need clarity, not code.*

### 🔍 What Is Git?

Git is a **version control system** used by developers, engineers, and IT teams to track changes to files, collaborate on work, and manage complex projects over time.

Think of it as **"Track Changes" in Word — but for everything.**

---

### ⚙️ Why Does Git Matter? why!!!!

* **Traceability:** Know exactly who changed what, when, and why
* **Rollback:** Revert bad changes instantly
* **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same files without overwriting each other
* **Backups:** Every version of every file is safely stored

#### ❌ Why Email-Based Change Tracking Falls Short:

Many companies still track changes through **email chains** — for example, "Please update this program," or "See attached revised drawing." This is risky because:

* Emails get lost or buried in inboxes
* Attachments are overwritten or versioned manually ("Final\_Final\_Rev3.2.xlsx")
* There's no audit trail or easy way to see *what changed and why*
* Updates depend on human memory and inbox discipline

With Git, everything is tracked in a secure, centralized way with full version history, comments, and authorship — no digging through email threads.

### 📊 What Does Git Look Like in Practice?

When a file is updated in Git, the system automatically creates a history log, like this:

```
commit 2f4a1bc - Updated feed rate per shift B feedback
Author: J. Smith <jsmith@company.com>
Date:   2024-05-21

commit 7d2e8fa - Initial CNC program load
Author: B. Foster <bfoster@company.com>
Date:   2024-05-20
```

You can also see what exactly changed between two versions:

```diff
- G1 X2.000 Y1.500 F50.0
+ G1 X2.000 Y1.500 F75.0  // Adjusted feed rate for material change
```

This means there's never any guessing — you know **exactly** who made the change, when, and why.

### 📦 What Is the GPL, and Is Git Really Free?

Yes, Git is **100% free**. It is licensed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**, which guarantees that:

* Anyone can use it
* Anyone can view and modify the source code
* Nobody can make it proprietary and lock you out of it

There are **no hidden fees**, subscriptions, or catch.

---

### 🏛️ Who Uses Git?

Git is used by:

* **NASA** (Mars Helicopter software was tracked with Git)
* **Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Amazon**
* **Automotive, Aerospace, Defense, and Energy** industries
* **Eaton** vendors and partners (very likely)

It’s the industry standard — like spreadsheets are for accounting.

---

### 🎓 Examples in Manufacturing & Engineering

* CNC programs are version-controlled to avoid re-running bad code
* Tool lists, setup sheets, and process docs can be tracked and shared
* Drawings and inspection sheets are updated with full revision history
* Operators, engineers, and programmers all speak the same language

### 🧩 Git vs. Email: A Quick Comparison

| Task                  | With Email                    | With Git                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Find last version     | Search inbox or ask around    | `git log` or visual history       |
| See what's changed    | Manually compare files        | Built-in `git diff`               |
| Know who made changes | Hope it's in the email        | Always tracked in commit metadata |
| Revert a mistake      | Dig up old attachment (maybe) | `git revert`                      |
| Team collaboration    | Risk overwriting changes      | Safe parallel work via branches   |

### 🖼️ Git Can Be Visual, Too

You don’t have to use the command line to benefit from Git. Tools like **GitHub Desktop**, **GitKraken**, or **TortoiseGit** give you a friendly visual interface with point-and-click control:

* View project history as a timeline
* Compare versions side-by-side
* Approve or reject changes like a modern inbox

> *“Git” doesn’t mean green text on a black screen — it can look just like Outlook, Excel, or any modern app.*

### 🚀 How to Get Started with Git at Your Site

1. **Pick a simple use case** — like setup sheets or CNC programs
2. **Choose a Git GUI** — GitHub Desktop, GitKraken, or TortoiseGit
3. **Create a shared repository** — on a server or even a synced folder
4. **Train one or two “Git champions”** — not everyone needs to know it
5. **Scale as needed** — start small, then expand to other files

---

### 📈 Real-World Impact

After tracking CNC programs in Git, one team reported:

> *“We reduced errors caused by outdated files by over 80% in one month. It paid for itself in less than a week.”*

---

### ✅ Bottom Line

Just because something hasn't been used before in your shop doesn't mean it lacks value. New tools like Git can dramatically improve how teams manage change, especially in high-stakes environments like aerospace. Sometimes, the most impactful improvements come from outside the usual way of doing things — even if they haven't been part of the workflow in the past.

* Git helps you **save time, prevent mistakes, and ensure traceability**
* It’s **free, open-source, and globally trusted**
* You don’t need to be a programmer to benefit from it

Even if you never type `git` in a terminal, your company runs smoother when someone else does.

*Want to implement Git at your site? You might have to be the one to lead the charge — many teams, especially in traditional manufacturing environments, haven’t adopted it yet and may not even be familiar with basic concepts like what a text file is.*

If your team isn’t highly technical, don’t worry — Git can be integrated into **simple, user-friendly workflows** with easy-to-use tools and visual interfaces. With the right setup, operators and staff never even need to know they’re using Git — it just works in the background to keep everything organized, backed up, and versioned.\*
