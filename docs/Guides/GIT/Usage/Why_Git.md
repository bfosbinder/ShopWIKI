### Introduction

Git, originally designed for software development, is an ideal solution for managing change in complex, high-accountability environments. In aerospace CNC manufacturing, where precision, traceability, and compliance are non-negotiable, Git delivers powerful advantages over traditional file and folder management.

### Key Advantages of Using Git in an Aerospace CNC Shop

#### 1. **Full Revision History with Traceability**

* Every change to a CNC program, setup sheet, or tooling list is logged.
* Who made the change, when, and why — all tracked automatically.
* Supports internal audits and external certification processes (AS9100, NADCAP).

#### 2. **No More Tribal Knowledge or File Chaos**

* Eliminates shared drives with folders like `FINAL_FINAL_2` or `RevB_NEWNEW`.
* Git provides a clean commit history instead of overwriting or duplicating files.

#### 3. **Built-In Comparison Tools**

* Instantly compare changes to G-code, Markdown setup sheets, and part documentation.
* Example: `git diff` shows exactly what changed between RevA and RevB.

#### 4. **Rollbacks and Recovery**

* Revert to a known-good version in seconds.
* If a program crashes a machine, it’s easy to recover and analyze.

#### 5. **Supports Concurrent Development**

* Engineers can safely work on new part revisions or improvements without impacting production.
* Branching models allow development in parallel while keeping `main` stable.

#### 6. **Compatible with Secure On-Prem Hosting**

* Git can run entirely offline or on a secure internal server.
* Ideal for ITAR, DFARS, and CUI environments.

#### 7. **Audit-Friendly and Compliant**

* Git logs are immutable.
* Facilitates compliance with document control standards and version tracking requirements.

#### 8. **Open Source and Cost-Effective**

* No licensing required.
* Easy to integrate into existing systems and scale over time.

### Recommended Usage in the Shop

* Version control setup sheets, tooling sheets, and CNC code.
* Use Markdown for human-readable setup documentation.
* Host Git repositories internally (e.g., GitLab CE, bare SSH server).
* Automate PDF exports or read-only dashboards for shop floor access.

### Conclusion

Git brings engineering-grade control to the heart of manufacturing operations. By adopting Git for document and program versioning, aerospace CNC shops gain not only clarity and control but also compliance and agility. It's a low-cost, high-impact upgrade to any modern shop's digital infrastructure.
