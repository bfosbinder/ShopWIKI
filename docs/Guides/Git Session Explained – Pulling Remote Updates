# 🔧 Git Session Explained – Pulling Remote Updates

```bash
brian@mx:~/ShopWIKI
$ git status
```

### 📋 Output:

```
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 4 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**✅ Summary:**

* You're on the `main` branch.
* Your local repo is **4 commits behind** the remote.
* There are no local changes.
* Git suggests running `git pull` to sync.

---

```bash
$ git pull
Enter passphrase for key '/home/brian/.ssh/id_ed25519':

Fast-forward
 docs/Guides/ipad-restore.md             | 9 +--------
 docs/Work_Instructions/261/1656952-1.md | 6 ++++++
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)
```

**📅 What Happened:**

* Git fetched and fast-forwarded your local branch to match the remote.
* Two files were updated:

  * `ipad-restore.md`: had 8 lines removed, 1 added.
  * `1656952-1.md`: had 6 lines added.
* No merge was necessary because your local branch had no new commits.

---

```bash
$ git status
```

### 📋 Output:

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**✅ Now:**

* You're fully synced with the remote.
* Nothing changed locally after the pull.

---

```bash
$ git push
Enter passphrase for key '/home/brian/.ssh/id_ed25519':
Everything up-to-date
```

**⬆️ Why Nothing Happened:**

* You haven’t made any new commits after the pull.
* There’s **nothing to push** to the remote.

---

## ✅ Final State: All Synced

* You started 4 commits behind.
* Pulled and fast-forwarded your branch.
* Ended fully up-to-date.
* No local changes, and push confirmed everything is synced.
