# 🛠️ Why We Should Evolve Beyond the Whiteboard

Currently, we log all change requests on a physical whiteboard and review them during our daily standup meetings. While this method provides immediate visibility and encourages live discussion, it has significant limitations in terms of traceability, accountability, and long-term value.

## ✅ Benefits of the Whiteboard System

- Easy to understand and use — no learning curve  
- Promotes daily conversations and team alignment  
- Always visible when you're physically present  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of the Whiteboard Approach

- **No long-term record** — once something is erased, it’s gone forever  
- **Not searchable or reportable** — hard to track patterns or recurring issues  
- **No accountability** — no assignments, due dates, or status indicators  
- **Limited access** — only visible in person, not ideal for multi-shift teams  
- **No integration** — can’t link to tooling, program changes, or digital logs

## 💡 A Better Approach: Digital Change Tracking

We should consider using a **lightweight issue tracking system** to log and manage change requests in a more structured way. This would allow us to:

- Keep a **searchable, permanent history** of all change requests  
- Assign changes to specific team members or shifts  
- Track status (open, in progress, complete) and priority  
- Add labels for machine, part number, shift, or reason for change  
- Review trends and recurring problems over time  
- Integrate with tools we already use (Teams, Git, SharePoint, etc.)

## 🔧 Suggested Tools (Easy to Implement)

| Tool              | Highlights                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trello**         | Visual board, drag-and-drop tasks, easy to use, great for team overviews  |
| **Microsoft Lists**| Integrated with Teams & SharePoint, customizable, structured data tracking |
| **GitHub Issues**  | Ideal if we already use Git; ties changes directly to program revisions    |
| **Notion**         | Combines documentation and task tracking in a flexible, modern interface   |

## 🧭 The Hybrid Approach

We don’t have to stop using the whiteboard right away. Instead, we can use it to highlight the **top priorities of the day** while maintaining a digital log for:

- Historical tracking  
- Follow-up  
- Documentation  
- Cross-shift communication

> **Conclusion**  
> By adding a simple issue tracker alongside our standup board, we’ll reduce dropped tasks, improve accountability, and gain valuable data to improve our processes long-term — without disrupting the team’s existing rhythm.
